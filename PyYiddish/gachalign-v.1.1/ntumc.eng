# NTU-MC/a-brief-history
While the earliest known historical records of Singapore are shrouded in the mists of time , a third century Chinese account describes it as " Pu-luo-chung " , or the " island at the end of a peninsula" .
Later , the city was known as Temasek ( " Sea Town " ) , when the first settlements were established from AD 1298-1299 .
During the 14th century , this small but strategically located island earned a new name .
According to the legend , Sang Nila Utama , a Prince from Palembang ( the capital of Srivijaya ) , was out on a hunting trip when he caught sight of an animal he had never seen before .
Taking it to be a good sign , he founded a city where the animal had been spotted , naming it " The Lion City " or Singapura , from the Sanskrit words " simha " ( lion ) and " pura " ( city ) .
At this time , the city was then ruled by the five kings of ancient Singapura .
Located at the tip of the Malay Peninsula , the natural meeting point of sea routes , the city served as a flourishing trading post for a wide variety of sea crafts , from Chinese junks , Indian vessels , Arab dhows and Portuguese battleships to Buginese schooners .
The next important period in the history of Singapore was during the 18th century , when modern Singapore was founded .
At this time , Singapore was already an up and coming trading post along the Malacca Straits , and Britain realised the need for a port of call in the region .
British traders needed a strategic venue to refresh and protect the merchant fleet of the growing empire , as well as forestall any advance made by the Dutch in the region .
The then Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen ( now Bengkulu ) in Sumatra , Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore on 29 January 1819 , after a survey of the neighbouring islands .
Recognising the immense potential of the swamp covered island , he helped negotiate a treaty with the local rulers , establishing Singapore as a trading station .
Soon , the island's policy of free trade attracted merchants from all over Asia and from as far away as the US and the Middle East .
In 1832 , Singapore became the centre of government for the Straits Settlements of Penang , Malacca and Singapore .
With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the advent of the telegraph and steamship , Singapore's importance as a centre of the expanding trade between the East and West increased tremendously .
By 1860 , the thriving country had a population that had grown from a mere 150 in 1819 to 80 , 792 , comprising mainly Chinese , Indians and Malays .
But the peace and prosperity of the country suffered a major blow during World War II , when it was attacked by the Japanese aircrafts on 8 December 1941 .
Once regarded as an impregnable fortress , Singapore fell under the Japanese invasion on 15 February 1942 .
It remained occupied by the Japanese for the next three and half years , a time marked by great oppression and an immense loss of lives .
When the Japanese surrendered in 1945 , the island was handed over to the British Military Administration , which remained in power until the dissolve of the Straits Settlement comprising Penang , Melaka and Singapore .
In March 1946 , Singapore became a Crown Colony .
In 1959 , the growth of nationalism led to self-government , and the country's first general election .
The People's Action Party ( PAP ) won a majority of 43 seats and Lee Kuan Yew became the first prime minister of Singapore .
In 1961 , Singapore joined Malaya and merged with the Federation of Malaya , Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia in 1963 .
However , the merger proved unsuccessful , and less than two years later on 9 August 1965 , Singapore left Malaysia to become an independent and sovereign democratic nation .
On 22 December that year , Singapore finally became an independent republic .
Today , you can experience Singapore's rich historical heritage by visiting many of the national monuments , museums and memorials located around the city .

# NTU-MC/ayam-buah-keluak
This dish is a staple Peranakan ( Straits-Chinese ) favourite that is truly memorable for its acquired yet robust flavour and taste .
Strong traditions have resulted in this golden recipe being passed down from generation to generation , making it a truly authentic Peranakan dish .
Made with chicken pieces ( and sometimes pork ) combined with " keluak " nuts ( an atypical type of nut which comes with a tough shell exterior , but oozes a piquant liquid inside ) , it produces an appealing yet unique flavor that must be tasted to be believed .
The dish isn't a simple one to make ; the rempah ( pounded spices ) alone is made of seven ingredients and takes half a day to fry .
Then , you have to scrub every nut , soak it in water for two days , chop off one end of the nut and dig out the black flesh inside .
Then you have to pound or blend it with some spices .
You have to neaten the nut's opening with a cutter so that it's presentable before you put the flesh back in ( phew , what hard labour!) .
Finally , you put the stuffed nuts , chicken and rempah on a simmer for another half a day until the sauce thickens .
Now that takes a lot of work .
So how about rewarding the hard work by trotting down to one of several Peranakan dining institutions to try it .
Restaurants like The Blue Ginger , Spice Peranakan ( if you have the time to venture out into the suburb of Buona Vista ) and Baba Inn & Lounge are some of the best Peranakan restaurants serving this dish in Singapore , which is not commonly found at typical eateries .
The dish is best eaten with a bowl of steamed rice , chincalok egg ( fermented shrimp omelette ) and sambal kangkong ( water spinach ) ; a truly heady combination if ever there was one .
# NTU-MC/baba-inn
Located in the fairly popular Siglap area , Baba Inn & Lounge takes on a casual air and yet , there is nothing casual about its food .
Peranakan cuisine is complex and requires a meticulous hand but this family restaurant impresses with traditional dishes such as the Nyonya ngoh hiang , assam prawns and Nyonya chap chye .
If you've enjoyed your dining experience at Peranakan Inn at East Coast Road , you will feel a good sense of déjà vu at the Baba Inn & Lounge , a related establishment .
# NTU-MC/bak-kut-teh
It consists of meaty pork ribs simmered in a unique broth of herbs and spices ; the use of cloves , cinnamon , star anise , fennel seeds and coriander in this dish reflects Singapore's diverse cultural influences .
The dish evolved as such in order to supplement the meagre , often innutritious diet of the coolies of yesteryear .
Yet , the dark-coloured soup rich in herbs and spices is just one of two versions of bak kut teh .
If you prefer a less herbal-tasting soup that's just as satisfying , you'll surely enjoy the other style of cooking , which serves up a soup that is clear and peppery .
The different varieties of this popular dish is a reflection of how descendants of immigrants from different parts of China have adapted bak kut teh to suit their palate .
The Cantonese have a strong soup-drinking culture and thus tend to add more medicinal herbs to the dish , whereas the Hokkiens , who prefer their food salty tasting , add soy sauce to darken the soup of the bak kut teh .
While many stalls situated along Singapore's popular clubbing strip at Mohammad Sultan Road offer hot servings of bak kut teh late into the night , some of the most famous bak kut teh can be found along Joo Chiat Road , available all through the day .
The dish can be enjoyed with both rice and noodles , and is most often served with you tiao ( deep-fried dough fritters) .
A bowl of bak kut teh tends to come with pork ribs , preserved vegetables and braised beancurd skins , all of which make this a wholesome , healthy and inexpensive option at any time of the day .
So popular is the bak kut teh concoction in Singapore that it's now a flavour in instant noodles and there's even a DIY kit , consisting of a soup base , that's ideal as a culinary souvenir from Singapore .

# NTU-MC/char-kway-teow
This extremely popular dish of flat rice noodles has a vibrant history .
In its early days , char kway teow was mostly sold by fishermen and farmers who doubled up as food peddlers at night to supplement their income ; they used to use leftovers from meals to whip up this dish , hence its multiple ingredient mix .
Char kway teow , loosely translated as " stir-fried rice cake strips " , is made by stir-frying flat rice noodles ( similar to the Italian tagliatelle ) with light and dark soy sauce , a dash of belachan ( shrimp paste ) , tamarind juice , bean sprouts , Chinese chives , lap cheong ( Chinese sausages ) and cockles .
In its original recipe , the rice noodles are also stir-fried in pork fat using crisp bits of pork lard , resulting in a distinctively rich taste .
In recent years , the dish as evolved into a healthier version with hawkers serving up more greens and adding less oil .
This not only makes the dish healthy but the greens and bean sprouts give it a freshness and crunchy texture , adding to the overall star quality of this old-time favourite .
The clanging wok and sweet-smelling hot air wafting from it gives it a heady , sensuous dimension of sight , smell and sound ; and that's even before you've taken a bite !
Char kway teow is easily available at most food centres in Singapore , such as at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre , and it's also a signature dish at the Princess Terrace Café .
Choose from either cockles or prawns to go with a plate of sizzling hot char kway teow , and have a hearty meal that satisfies your sinful cravings .
If you're heading to Zouk for a spot of clubbing , then why not stop off at the nearby Zion Road Hawker Centre ( no need to mention the stall here ; you'll recognise it instantly from its long queues of eager customers ) for a scrumptious plate of this famous dish from a much-lauded , famous hawker .
# NTU-MC/chilli-crab
Some of the best places to lap up this stunning creation include No Signboard Seafood Restaurant , Jumbo Seafood and Long Beach Seafood at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village which sits right by the beach at East Coast Park .
What makes this dish so special is its sensuous , sweet yet savoury sauce , created with a base of chilli and tomato sauces which will electrify your palate and satisfy your taste buds .
The red-tangy sauce is made deliciously fragrant with light flavourings of garlic and rice vinegar , while thickening flour and egg ribbons ( produced by adding beaten eggs towards the end of the cooking process ) give the chilli crab dish the fluffy texture it's known for .
For extra oomph , order some mantou ( toasted buns ) to scoop up the thick gravy , which will leave you hankering for more .
While mud crabs are commonly used in the preparation of this dish , other varieties such as the soft-shell crab can also be used .
If you're a fan of seafood , this is one dish that you must chase after while you're here in Singapore .

Deepavali is the celebration of good over evil , and light overcoming darkness .
While there are various legends that inspire this festival , the common tale is about how Narakasura won the favor of God and was blessed with the rule of a kingdom .

Some Indian communities also begin the financial year on Deepavali for auspicious reasons .

An incorruptible Minister of State , Qu Yuan apparently became so upset with the acts of corruption within his government that he threw himself into the Mei Lo River in despair .
The rowing action of the dragon-boaters thus symbolise the desperate attempts of the village fishermen at beating their oars on the water to drive away man-eating fish as they tried to rescue .
While the fishermen were not able to save Qu Yuan , the tradition of throwing cooked rice dumplings ( also known as " ba chang " ) wrapped in silk or banana leaves to appease the spirits of the river continues in today's festival activities .
Today , dragon boat racing is a more cheerful spectacle .
Show your support and cheer as the beautifully decorated boats splash and race across the surface of the water , and witness a whole range of ancient rites that are still performed here , including the showering of the dragon head of the boat before each race .
Dragon Boat Racing is a must for all sports fans , as it is a competitive , vigorous sport with lots of action , thrills and spills ; and is just as ideal for great day full of wholesome family fun and entertainment .
What's more , dragon boat racing , with its fearsome drumbeats , mesmerising chants and intense camaraderie is also a joy to watch and savour .
The Kallang River just outside the Central Business District is another venue where you can take in dragon boat racing .
Here , various dragon boat racing clubs have practices and competitive sessions during the weekends , and it's a perfect place if you want to give the sport a go and get some hands-on practice Date to note : 6 June 2011

# NTU-MC/driving-to-singapore
You may want to embark on a scenic driving trip to Singapore yourself , especially if you reside in nearby cities in Malaysia or Thailand .
If you're driving a foreign-registered vehicle , you may have to acquire an Autopass card ( a vehicle entry permit ) at either the Woodlands or Tuas Checkpoint arrival zones before you enter Singapore .
Be reminded that it is an offence to drive in Singapore without an Autopass Card for your foreign-registered vehicle .
If you're driving a foreign-registered commercial vehicle ( such as a bus or goods vehicle ) , you only need to pay tolls using the Autopass card , while Singapore-registered vehicles need to pay tolls using the NETS CashCard .
All vehicle entry permit ( VEP ) fees , toll charges and / or ERP charges need to be paid using the Autopass card and not the NETS Cashcard if you're driving a foreign-registered vehicle .
VEP fees are calculated on a daily basis and are not charged on Saturdays , Sundays and all Singapore Public Holidays .
Since 2005 , all drivers of foreign-registered vehicles can drive into Singapore for a maximum of 10 days in each calendar year without having to pay VEP fees .
However , toll charges still apply .
Toll charges are calculated on a per trip basis , to be paid on arrival and departure at the Tuas Checkpoint , but only on departure at the Woodlands Checkpoint .

# NTU-MC/dumpling-noodles
Served dry or in soup , Wanton Mee comes in two distinct versions , the Hong Kong-style version or the Malaysian and Singaporean version .
Hong Kong-style Wanton Mee is usually served in a clear broth , with dumplings filled with ingredients such as prawns and pork .
The thin noodles are blanched quickly , giving it an al dente texture .
Extremely popular in Cantonese restaurants , a good Hong Kong-style Wanton Mee should feature slightly crunchy noodles and plump dumplings with a translucent skin , filled with goodies such as prawns , pork and black fungus .
Some good family restaurants which feature Hong Kong-style Wanton Mee include Crystal Jade Kitchen and Imperial Treasure Cantonese Cuisine .
The Singaporean and Malaysian versions are largely similar , offering slices of Char Siew ( barbecued pork ) , in addition to bite-sized dumplings and leafy vegetables .
The local version is often eaten dry , and sometimes comes with deep-fried dumplings as well .
The sauce for dry Wanton Mee varies from stall to stall , with the Malaysia version made with black soy sauce , and the Singaporean version consisting of tomato sauce , chilli sauce and sesame oil .
Char Siew plays an important role in local Wanton Mee , with succulent and charred slices considered the best .
Egg noodles are also used , and are usually yellow , springy and flat .
Char Siew is also eaten with rice , together with a sweet barbeque dipping sauce .
Char Siew marbled with fat is the most flavourful , as it gives it a distinct charred taste .
However , lean Char Siew has become more popular with the health-conscious .
In recent years , other variations of Wanton Mee have made appearances , such as Kolo Mee from Sarawak .
Good and authentic local Wanton Mee can be found cheaply in food centres in Singapore , with some stalls more well-known then others .
Some popular food stalls that sell it include Foong Kee Coffee Shop along Keong Siak Road , Kok Kee Wanton Mee at Lavender Food Centre , and Happy Wanton Noodle at Bukit Timah Food Centre .
Wanton Mee is a must-try for all noodle lovers and will definitely leave you wanting more .

# NTU-MC/fish-head-curry
Originally created by Singapore's Malayalee ( an Indian ethnic group from the Southern Indian state of Kerala ) community , it is prepared by stewing the head of an ikan merah ( red snapper fish ) in a spicy-hot curry with vegetables ; with the sour-tasting tamarind flavour an unmistakable signature of this dish .
Visitors can either have it with rice or as the Chinese do it - wipe the curry gravy clean with a soft bun .
The sweetness of the dough helps to neutralize the spices in the curry - a great way to enjoy the dish even if you have a low tolerance for spice .
The Chinese tend to have it alongside smaller dishes of vegetables and meat ; head down to McCullum Street in the heart of the city for a taste at the famous Ocean Fish Head Curry eatery .
The Indians likewise tend to eat it in a similar manner , having it with rice , pappadams and Indian pickle ; check out the Banana Leaf Apolo in Little India , as well as the famous Muthu's Curry on Race Course Road , which is just a few yards away .
Savour the soft chunks of meat and dig into the eyes of the fish and complement the spicy flavours with a tall glass of Kingfisher ( Indian beer ) or ice-cold lemonade .
This is another dish you must have during your visit here , as you are unlikely to find something like this anywhere else in the world .
# NTU-MC/five-star-hainanese-chicken-rice

The homemade chilli sauce and ginger are also excellent accompaniments to this fragrant dish .
Other great dishes here include the Hainanese pork chop and homemade tofu ( beancurd ) .
So whenever you're craving that plate of aromatic Hainanese chicken rice , be sure to think of Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice , home to one of Singapore's national dishes .

# NTU-MC/folk-dances
Most of the ethnic communities in Singapore still practise rural traditions of their village ancestors from many years ago .
One of the traditions that continue to charm visitors today is the classic folk dance , existing across cultures though the various dances themselves may differ .
Visiting artists from India brought with them the dance of the courtesans , both graceful and aggressive , to local Singaporean stages .
Malay folk dances are the result of foreign influences brought about by passing travellers .
For example , the Zapin has Arab roots while the Joget adopts the lightness of movement from Portuguese folk dance .
The Chinese , meanwhile , know quite a variety of traditional folk dances , an art inherited from their ancestors who migrated to Singapore from various parts of China .
From the Han province comes the dance of the Rice Harvest , performed with authentic sieves to depict young girls harvesting crop under the hot sun .
Chinese folk dances such as these are performed every year during the Chingay Festival .

The plain versions are light and nutty , while those that are filled with sweet red bean or lotus seed paste are equally enjoyable .
Kuih Bom is the Malay version of this snack , and is prepared the same way .
The only difference is that Kuih Bom often contains shredded sweetened coconut , as well as the occasional green or red bean paste .
Other snacks and desserts made from glutinous rice flour include Nian Gao and Tangyuan .
Nian Gao , a sticky and sweet pudding , is traditionally eaten during Chinese New Year .
Meaning " a greater or higher year " in Chinese , it is eaten steamed or pan-fried ( and sometimes with egg ) during this time for good luck , although it's also available all year round .
On the other hand , Tangyuan is traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival .
Today , however , it can also be found at food centres and even in supermarkets all year round .
Served with a sweet soup , it comes either plain or filled with a variety of fillings , such as ground sesame , ground peanuts or red bean paste .
Jian Dui , with its golden colour and round shape , resembling gold coins , is a symbol of fortune and wealth .
There is a Chinese belief that as the Jian Dui grows bigger when it is fried , so will your wealth .

You can also access the automated teller machines ( ATMs ) located everywhere ( even in the most obscure bits ) in Singapore , that accept most of the main credit cards such as Visa , MasterCard and American Express .
Weather Singapore is known for its hot and humid weather , with little variation throughout the year .
The average daytime temperature is 31ºC ( 88ºF ) , dropping to around 24ºC ( 75ºF ) in the evenings .
The monsoon season can bear down pretty heavily on our tropical weather from November onwards , so be prepared for rain on a daily basis during this period .
Cell Phone Usage Singapore's international dialing code is +(65) .
While in Singapore and if you have international roaming service on your cell phone , you don't have to press + ( 65 ) as it will automatically connect you to the local numbers here .
( No ) Smoking Besides air-conditioned areas such as shopping centres , restaurants , entertainment outlets and cinemas , smoking is also an offence on the SMRT ( Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system ) , public buses , taxis and in lifts .
Recently , the smoking ban has also been imposed on public eateries and within a five-metre radius from most building entrances , except for allocated smoking areas that are clearly marked with bright yellow paint .
A maximum fine of S$1,000 may be imposed on first-time offenders .
GST Refund Scheme Enjoy tax-free shopping in Singapore at locations with the " Tax Refund " logo .

Simply spend SGD 100.00 or more at participating retailers to qualify for refunds .
Refunds may be claimed either directly from retailers or at Changi and Seletar Airport .
Please note that this Scheme is not applicable if you leave by land or by sea .

The refund amount is valid after an administration fee is deducted from the GST .
Always check with retailers to find out if you can claim the tax before confirming your purchase .
There are two GST refund schemes , and you are advised to check on the minimum purchase amount to qualify for the GST refund as it varies between retailers .
For more information on the two Central Refund Agencies , please contact : Global Refund 24-hour Hotline : +65 6225 6238 Email : taxfree@sg.globalrefund.com www.globalrefund.com Premier Tax Free 24-hour Hotline : 1800 829 3733 Email : info@sg.premiertaxfree.com www.premiertaxfree.com Consumer Advisory Most Singapore retailers have fair business practices , but there are a small number of shops and restaurants that might make your shopping experience less than ideal .
Here are some smart shopping tips to ensure that your retail experience is a pleasant one .
1 .
Always do price comparisons to get the best deals Prices can vary widely between shops because distributors are not obliged to abide by each product's Recommended Retail Price ( RRP ) .
Ask the retailer also if the 7% Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) applies .
Also note that purchases above SGD100 in a single receipt entitle you to GST refunds if you leave Singapore by air .
Please read the section on the GST Refund Scheme for more information .
2 .
Note that purchases made are usually final In Singapore , retailers generally enforce strict return , exchange or refund policies the moment payment is made .
Always ask your retailer about their policies before making payment for your purchase .
3 .
Check receipts or invoices for accuracy Do remember to ask for a receipt of invoice whenever you make a purchase , and keep it for reference .
Also check that prices and item descriptions are correct to ensure that you do not pay more than what is required .
Remember to check that gifts , when applicable , should be indicated as such .
4 .
Verify what your ‘international warranty' covers International warranties are not standardised , and you should always ask and verify that your warranty is valid in your home country .
Ensure that both your invoice and warranty card bear your retailer's stamp and signature .
In the case of electronic goods , note down the product's serial number as well .
- Also note that there are no international warranties on the purchase of mobile phones .
- A " worldwide local warranty " means that the warranty is available only in the country of purchase - " worldwide" here refers to the availability of the product , not the warranty .
- Parallel imported items have no warranty , and retailers usually do not entertain returns , refunds or exchanges .
5 .
Check before leaving the store Before making payment , make sure that you test the item you wish to purchase , and take time to check that the promised accessories and peripherals are included in the package , and work as they should .
For additional assistance or complaints , call Touristline at 1800 736 2000 ( toll-free in Singapore ) , or ( 65 ) 6736 2000 ( from overseas) .

# NTU-MC/hainanese-chicken-rice
Hainanese chicken rice is a gem of a recipe adapted from early Chinese immigrants originally from the Hainan province in southern China .
The dish is simple : bite-sized pieces of steamed white chicken , fragrant rice ( it's pre-fried in chicken fat and cooked in chicken broth ) , light or dark soy sauce , and a delicious ground chilli and ginger paste .
For the dish to sizzle as a whole all parts must be equally up to par or else it'll easily slip into the realm of the mediocre .
In fact , the accompanying ground chilli paste has the ability to make or break the dish ; too hot will make for an uncomfortable dining experience , too mild will leave the dish tasting bland as a whole .
A lot of effort goes into the preparation of this flavourful dish , with cooks first steaming the chicken until it is fully cooked , before immediately soaking it in cold water .
This stops the cooking process and ensures that the meat remains tender , and is also why the meat is usually served at room temperature .
Usually accompanied by a bowl of light chicken broth , thin slices of cucumber , chilli mixed with dark soy sauce , and ginger paste , a good plate of chicken rice can easily be found at many hawker centres in the city , including Maxwell Road Hawker Centre and restaurants like Checkers .
Simple yet tasty , Hainanese chicken rice is Singaporeans' choice comfort food , making it another must-try .

# NTU-MC/hari-raya-hajii
Hari Raya Haji , otherwise known as the " Festival of Sacrifice " , is celebrated over a period of three days by Muslims all over the world .
It commemorates the Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son in the name of God .
According to the Islamic calendar , Hijrah , this festival starts on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja , 70 days after the holy month of Ramadan .
Practicing Muslims celebrate this auspicious day to mark the end of Hajj , the annual holy pilgrimage to Mecca .
The Hajj , which is currently the largest annual pilgrimage in the world , sees thousands of pilgrims simultaneously converge on the Holy land to perform a series of rituals .
It is also considered the fifth pillar of Islam , a religious obligation for able-bodied Muslims with the financial means .
It is not just a powerful demonstration of the solidarity between Muslim men and women , but also of their complete submission to Allah ( God in the Islamic scriptures of the Quran) .
During this public holiday , male volunteers congregate in the mosques to offer their prayers and reflect upon the sermons that are read out .
After performing the customary Hari Raya Haji prayers , they then sacrifice sheep , goats and cows .
This act symbolises Prophet Ibrahim's readiness to sacrifice his own flesh and blood .
The meat is then packed and distributed among the Muslim community , especially to families who are less fortunate .
This day , which is the perfect time to observe the ethics and practices of the Muslim community , serves as a reminder to share one's wealth with the less fortunate .
After a long day of carrying out customary practices , the Muslims would then pay a visit to their parents , families and friends for a hearty lunch and merrymaking .
Within the city itself , you can partake in the festivities in areas such as Geylang Serai and Kampong Glam , where lively bazaars and dazzling local decorations are held to mark this important day for locals and visitors to soak in the atmosphere .

# NTU-MC/hokkien-prawn-mee
Hokkien Prawn Mee was created by the post war Hokkien sailors from South China .
After working in the factories , they would congregate along Rochor Road and fry excess noodles from the noodle factories over a charcoal stove .
Today , this dish is stir-fried with garlic , eggs , soy sauce , yellow noodles , bee hoon , bean sprouts , prawns and squid .
A flavourful stock is also essential for a great tasting dish , and is usually made from stewing prawn heads , clams and dried fish .
To cook this dish , the noodles are first flooded with stock , stewed for a minute while adding the seafood , then fried till damp .
Pork lard is also a vital part of Hokkien Prawn Mee ; however , most stalls use less or none of it nowadays as it is deemed as unhealthy .
Sambal chilli and lime are also standard toppings for this dish , giving it that extra zing and tanginess .
Some stalls also serve it on an Opei leaf ( soft palm bark ) , to enhance the fragrance of the dish .
So head down to Nam Sing Fried Hokkien Mee or Geylang Lor 29 Fried Hokkien Mee , two of Singapore's most famous Hokkien Prawn Mee stalls , for a plate of mouthwatering noodles today .

# NTU-MC/hungry-ghost-festival
Every year , usually in the month of September , the Chinese in Singapore observe a large-scale tradition of paying respects to the dead .
Taoist Chinese believe that during this month , the " Gates of Hell " are opened and souls of the dead are freed and allowed to roam the earth .
The best places to watch how the traditional rites are practised in Singapore are in the soul of the heartlands , where fellow believers congregate to burn incense sticks and present their offerings in the form of prayer , fruit such as Mandarin oranges , food such as roasted suckling pig , bowls of rice and occasionally a local Chinese cake made especially for the occasion .
It is not uncommon to see various forms of tentage set up in open fields during this period , for the Chinese also believe in entertaining the spirits with boisterous live wayang and getai performances not only depicting tales of the divine gods and goddesses , but also bawdy stand-up comedy with a local twang , song and dance numbers in the various Chinese dialects and even sensually acrobatic pole dancing by felinely lithe spandex clad dancers .
Everyone is welcome to watch the show as long as you don't sit at the front row , which is reserved for the " special guests" .
The festival is so widely-practised here that special joss paper bins have been set up for believers to burn their paper money in , believed to translate into great fortune in the afterlife .
Small altars can also be seen outside many homes , both on private property and in public housing areas .
From grand feasts costing thousands of dollars to a mélange of puppetry , opera and singing performances , the various ways with which the Chinese appease these roaming spirits is fascinating to watch , these festivities usually take place across the various neighbourhoods like Chinatown , Redhill and Geylang - so check these out if you're feeling a little adventurous and want to lose yourself in a truly local experience .
Dates to note : Hungry Ghost Festival - 10 Aug - 7 Sep 2010
# NTU-MC/ice-kachang
The first ice-cold dessert introduced ( way back long ago ) in Singapore was ice balls , finely grated ice packed into a ball and topped with a type of coloured sugar coated syrup , typically eaten by using just the fingers or hands .
The ice ball was a common sight in the 1950s and 1960s and was sold by the roadside and street corners , usually by pushcart drink vendors wanting to supplement their ( meagre ) income .
The ice kachang is a thus modern , more elaborate update of the ice ball--comprising jelly , red beans ( hence the name ; kachang means beans in Malay ) , sweet corn and attap chee ( palm seeds ) as its base , and topped off with a mound of shaved ice , psychedelically coloured syrups and condensed milk ; and it's served in either a bowl or a tall glass .
Today , ice kachang even comes with fruit cocktail , aloe vera jelly and novelty toppings such as chocolate and durian to satisfy the selective palate of the savvy Singaporean crowd .
This fun ( if served in a bowl , it usually comes mound-shaped , and all these lovely ingredients are tucked under the ice shavings ; so there's quite a bit of fun to be had by digging your way to the " goodies " ) and colourful dessert can be had at food centres all across the city such as the popular Maxwell Road Hawker Centre in Chinatown .
Remember to savour this lovely dessert dish slowly , or else : Brain Freeze !
It's sometimes hard for the new visitor to Singapore to suss out the good from the bad ice kachangs out there .
But bear this in mind : A good ice kachang is one where the ice is cleanly shaven to very small bits ; so much so that when you put a spoonful in your mouth , the ice should just melt in your mouth together with the sweet tasting syrup .
As for ingredients , the more varied the better ; nothing like biting in multiple textures every time you take a mouthful .

# NTU-MC/indian-classical-music
What sets Indian classical music apart from most other genres is its emphasis on melody and the staccato nature of its notes .
Although it has been divided into Hindusthani ( Northern Indian ) and Carnatic ( Southern Indian ) , the origins and fundamental concepts of both types of music remain the same .
The one thing to watch out for is how these two types of classical music vary in terms of presentation and musical invocation .
# NTU-MC/indian-cuisines
When you've established that you want Indian food for your next meal , your next decision to make has to do with whether you would like North Indian cuisine or South Indian food .
Here in Singapore , you'll find plenty of both varieties .
In general , you'll find that most Indian dishes are infused with flavoured spices and herbs such as cardamom , cloves , cumin , coriander and chillies .
North Indian food is often cooked with yogurt , while the dishes in the South frequently rely on coconut milk to temper the spicy dishes .
A North Indian menu at a restaurant like Spices of India features mild curries , creamy yogurt based dishes , tandoori items baked in a tandoori or clay oven , fluffy naan breads , lentils , desserts and milk-based sweetmeats , while a South Indian restaurant such as Annalakshmi offers you vegetarian thosai and fiery curries enriched with coconut milk .
Often served on a banana leaf or a thali , vegetarian meals consist of vegetables , pickles , chutney and bread .
South Indian cuisine also includes delectable seafood dishes from Kerala .
One of the most famous Indian dishes that you can try in Singapore is fish head curry , but what may surprise you is the fact that it is actually not Indian .
While it does reflect Indian cooking in its complex use of spices , the fish head curry is more of a local creation , and is also available in Chinese cuisine as well .
Stroll by stalls at food centres around the city and you'll notice yet another hybrid form of food that is more Indian-Muslim in nature .
Sample the roti prata , a flaky griddle fried bread served with curry , or try the murtabak - fried bread stuffed with shredded chicken or mutton , onions and egg .
Pay a visit to Little India and see the temples , goldsmiths and other shops that sell a variety of items from imported Indian vegetables , accessories , prayer items and more .

# NTU-MC/key-facts
Many people marvel at the beauty of Singapore and her progressiveness .
Most impressive to note is that she was formerly just a humble fishing village , inhabited by an indigenous settlement .
Fast forward to today .
Singapore is a bustling cosmopolitan city populated with high-rise buildings and landscape gardens .
Brimming with a harmonious blend of culture , cuisine , arts and architecture , Singapore is a dynamic city that's rich in contrast and colour .
In fact , you can even say that Singapore embodies the finest of both East and West .
Located in Southeast Asia , Singapore has a land area of about 710 square kilometres , making her one of the smallest countries in the world and the smallest in the region - hence the moniker " The Little Red Dot" .
Although small in size , Singapore commands an enormous presence in the world today with its free trade economy and highly efficient workforce .
Also , her strategic location in the region has enabled her to become a central sea port along major shipping routes .
Other than having a sound business infrastructure and favourable economic climate , another factor for Singapore's rapid growth is due to a stable and competent ruling government .
Singapore is a parliamentary republic with a political system that's centred on democracy .
The current ruling party in government is The People's Action Party ( PAP ) , which has dominated the political process since self-government in 1959 .
At present , Singapore's population stands at about five million people , with English as the main language of instruction , and a mother tongue for each major ethnicity .
One of the distinctly Singaporean things you'll notice on our island is a ubiquitous collage of cultures .
Coming together as a society and living in harmony , there are four major races - namely the Chinese ( majority ) , Malay , Indian and Eurasian .
Each community offers a different perspective of life in Singapore in terms of culture , religion , food and language .
Being a multi-racial society , Singapore is as diverse as it is cohesive .
With so much to see and do , this is perhaps best experienced through your encounters with the locals .
And if you're feeling nostalgic and looking to discover old world charm , you can explore and experience the island's key historical landmarks or memorials .
You can also embark on a heritage trail and enjoy the sights and sounds at various cultural precincts , notably Chinatown , Little India and Kampong Glam .
If you prefer the bright city lights and being amidst the hustle and bustle , then you'll be delighted to know that there are numerous shopping malls , museums , and dining and entertainment hotspots to choose from .
Get into the thick of the shopping action at the iconic Orchard Road stretch , or party the night away at the Clarke Quay or Boat Quay areas , both of which offer a myriad selection of nightlife activities .
The other thing that will strike you most about Singapore is its multifarious offering of food - day or night , there will always be something to whet your appetite .
With a range of dining options from Peranakan to Chinese , Indian to Malay , fusion and more , you'll be spoilt for choice .
Beyond the history , culture , people , shopping and food , there are many more facets to Singapore's thriving cityscape for you to discover .
And these can only be experienced as you immerse yourself in the exploration of this once fishing village turned cosmopolitan city .

The lion head represents the lion spotted by Prince Sang Nila Utama when he re-discovered Singapura in 11 AD , as recorded in the " Malay Annals " , and the fish tail of the Merlion symbolises the ancient city of Temasek ( meaning " sea " in Javanese ) by which Singapore was known before the Prince named it " Singapura " ( meaning " lion city " in Sanskrit) .
The Merlion is representative of Singapore's humble beginnings as a fishing village , and is a national icon that you must visit on your trip here .
Don't forget to capture a view of the seafront and the Merlion set against the backdrop of skyscrapers in Singapore's Central Business District while you're here .
# NTU-MC/mid-autumn-festival
The Mid-Autumn Festival , also called the Mooncake or Lantern Festival , is a traditional harvest festival that is celebrated annually by the Chinese .
This year , the festival takes place from 11 September to 10 October .
Much like a thanksgiving , it is an important occasion that is spent with family and friends .
To celebrate this festival , mooncakes and pomelos are eaten , while activities such as carrying and lighting lanterns also take place .
Join in the festivities at numerous events such as the Chinatown Mid-Autumn Festival Street Light-up and the Mass Lantern Walk , and soak in the vibrant atmosphere under the moonlit sky this season .
# NTU-MC/mooncakes
History has it that during the Yuan dynasty in China , Zhu Yuanzhang , the leader of the Ming Army , conceived the plan to use mooncakes to distribute messages to the people , so as to overthrow the Mongolian rule .
On the 15th day of the eighth lunar month , when the moon was at its fullest , the people formed a rebellion and overthrew their oppressors , hence establishing the Ming dynasty .
This day is now used to commemorate the Mid-Autumn Festival and is celebrated with the lighting of lanterns , as well as the eating of mooncakes and pomelo fruits .
Mooncakes are usually round or square shaped , and are made up of a thin skin covering a sweet dense filling , sometimes containing salted egg yolks .
Traditionally , the skin of a mooncake is made from a chewy brown dough made with lard .
This dough is also used to make fish or piglet shaped biscuits that are sold with mooncakes , largely popular with children .
Today , other types of mooncake skins , such as those made out of flaky pastry and snow skin , are commonplace .
The Chinese characters for longevity or harmony are often imprinted on the top of mooncakes .
Other imprints include the name of the bakery , the filling , as well as images of flowers , the moon or Chang Er ( the goddess of the moon in Chinese folklore) .
The original filling for mooncakes is said to be lotus seed paste , but fillings like red bean paste and yam paste are also widespread .
Modern varieties of mooncakes have also popped up in recent years , including flavours such as durian , ice-cream , bird's nest , chocolate , green tea , cream cheese , chempedek and more .
Many establishments in Singapore sell mooncakes , with Chinese restaurants , bakeries and hotels producing highly sought after creations .
Some popular outlets include Raffles Hotel , Chop Tai Chong Kok at Sago Street and Tai Thong Cake Shop at Mosque Street .
Be it traditional mooncakes or those with a twist , these treats are sure to send you over the moon .

# NTU-MC/mosaic-music-festival
Held at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay , the annual Mosaic Music Festival is a 10-day regionally acclaimed festival that showcases a gamut of musical genres that will satisfy music aficionados from all age groups and walks of life .
Better known as the Esplanade , the venue is Singapore's premier destination for all things cultural , musical and artistic , and its distinct shape by the Marina Bay in the heart of the CBD has earned this landmark the lovable nickname of " The Durian " since it opened to the public in 2002 .
Originally set up as a festival focused on world-music and jazz acts , Mosaic's line-up now boasts everything that's sensationally aural from indie-folk music , to soulful rhythm and blues and booty bouncing hip-hop , to electrifying post-rock , sumptuously exotic Afrobeat and grungy ‘90s throwback indie rock - a meld which has allowed the festival to garner larger audiences every year .
What's really amazing is that these artistes perform in a multitude of sonically suitable venues around the Esplanade from the raucous Theatre Studio , to the intimate Mosaic recital studio and the smooth acoustic aura of the venerable Concert Hall ; ensuring that musical connoisseurs derive maximum satisfaction from their gigs .
Some of the musical outfits that have performed in the first four years of the festival's inception include legendary multi-Grammy award winning hip-hop heads The Roots , avant-garde African music maestro Dhafer Youssef , jazz superstar Harry Connick Jr and psychedelically experimental indie-pop vaudevilles of Montreal .
Tickets for highly sought-after performances in its line-up always sell out quickly ; a testament to the festival's ever-growing popularity .
The Mosaic Music Festival is a fantastic way to unwind , relax and engage in some of the best concerts in the region with like-minded friends at the Esplanade , the throbbing epicentre of the arts and entertainment in Singapore .

# NTU-MC/nasi-lemak
There are two versions of this classic ; the Malay ( original ) version has a straightforward offering of ikan bilis ( fried anchovies ) and nuts , fried fish , cucumber and sometimes an egg ; whereas the Chinese version , like Chong Pang Nasi Lemak and the Changi Village Nasi Lemak ( take the Bus No.2 to the Changi Village market to sample this unforgettable version ) have a whole bunch of things like deep fried drumstick , chicken franks , fish cake , curried vegetables and luncheon meat ( Asian Spam ) in it .
Like the chicken rice , the accompanying chilli condiment can make all the difference ; sometimes the chilli and plain lemak rice is enough for a satisfying meal .
Nasi lemak is always enjoyable whether at breakfast or any other time of day , and some stalls still retain the tradition of wrapping the rice in a banana leaf to enhance its flavour .
It is commonly found at food centres in Singapore , with the more famous nasi lemak stalls being the ones at the Adam Road Food Centre .
# NTU-MC/nasi-padang
Nasi padang dishes are prepared in a hot , dry style of cooking unique to Indonesian cuisine , and are rich in flavour and aroma .
Singapore's local nasi padang stalls however , have made a name for themselves by consciously blending healthier alternatives such as less salt added in dishes and bigger vegetable portions into their overall spread .
Nasi padang dishes are typically shared like a mini buffet with friends or family , each member helping himself to his personal favourites and placing a scoop of everything on his plate of rice .
The most popular nasi padang stall in Singapore is Hajjah Maimunah Nasi Padang in the Kampong Glam district , which provides a homely dining experience that's perfect for big groups wanting to sample a wide range of dishes .
But you don't have to go the Kampong Glam or Geylang areas of Singapore to try this Malay-Indonesian fare ; there are numerous nasi padang outlets dotting the city , even in places like the CBD , where lunchtime patrons flock to well-known outlets for their regular nasi padang fix .
When you arrive at a nasi padang stall , you'll be confronted with an array of dishes displayed in a glass-panelled counter .
Do not be intimidated by this sight ; just point at the dish you fancy having ( or ask the stall helper for recommendations ) and you'll be promptly served .
This is often the best-value-for-money value meal you'll find during your time in Singapore .
# NTU-MC/national-day
Not only do the days leading up to Singapore's National Day on 9 August are set abuzz by pulsating , patriotic vibes all around the country , this is also the best time to take in our lush cityscape .

# NTU-MC/people-lang-culture
One of the most remarkable aspects of Singapore is the truly cosmopolitan nature of her population , a natural result of the country's geographical position and commercial success .
Established by Thomas Stamford Raffles as a trading post on 29 January 1819 , the small sea town of Singapore soon attracted migrants and merchants from China , the Indian sub-continent , Indonesia , the Malay Peninsula and the Middle East .
Drawn by the lure of better prospects , the immigrants brought with them their own cultures , languages , customs and festivals .
Intermarriage and integration helped knit these diverse influences into the fabric of Singapore's multi-faceted society , giving it a vibrant and diverse cultural heritage .
By the end of the 19th century , Singapore became one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Asia , with major ethnic groups in the country being the Chinese , Malays , Indians , Peranakans and Eurasians .
Today , the ethnic Chinese form 74.2% of the Singaporean population , with the country's original inhabitants - the Malays , comprising of 13.4% .
The Indians make up 9.2% , and Eurasians , Peranakans and others making up a combined 3.2% .
Singapore is also home to many expatriates , with almost 20% of them made up of non-resident blue collar workers from the Philippines , Indonesia and Bangladesh .
The rest of the expatriate population include white collar workers coming from countries as diverse as North America , Australia , Europe , China and India .
As a reflection of its collage of cultures , Singapore has adopted one representative language for each of the four major ethnic or 'racial' groups .
The four official languages in Singapore's constitution are English , Chinese , Malay and Tamil .
However , in recognition of the status of the Malay people as the indigenous community in Singapore , the national language of the country is Bahasa Melayu , or the Malay Language .
The presence of other languages , especially the varieties of Malay and Chinese , has obviously had an influence on the type of English that is used in Singapore .
The influence is especially apparent in informal English , an English-based creole that is commonly known as Singlish .
A badge of identity for many Singaporeans , it represents a hybrid form of the language that includes words from Malay , as well as Chinese and Indian languages .
Almost everyone in Singapore speaks more than one language , with many people speaking as many as three or four .
Most children grow up bilingual from infancy , learning other languages as they become older .
With the majority of the literate population bilingual , English and Mandarin are the most commonly used languages in daily life .

# NTU-MC/peranakan-cuisines
The cuisine comes from the Peranakans , the descendants of the original Chinese immigrants who had settled in Penang , Malacca , Indonesia and Singapore , and inter-married with the local Malays .
It's also referred to as " Nonya " , an old Malay word which was used as a term of respect and affection for women of prominent social standing .
Peranakans believe that the distinct flavour of their recipes owes itself to the " rempah " , a combination of spices with a very specific texture and density that is pounded into a paste with a pestle and mortar .
Small wonder that Peranakan recipes involve a time-consuming and lengthy preparation and are handed down from one generation to the next .
Interestingly , a Nonya was supposed to be able to judge the cooking ability of her new daughter-in-law merely by listening as she prepared the rempah with a mortar .
An imaginative and creative cuisine infused with delicate flavours , Peranakan or Nonya food employs chillies , belachan and coconut milk as vital ingredients in its cooking .
It blends the ingredients and wok cooking techniques of the Chinese with the spices used by the Malay and Indonesian community to create tangy , aromatic and spicy dishes .
You'll be interested to learn that this unique cuisine displays subtle regional differences in its style of cooking .
For instance , the dishes that originate from the Penang use tamarind and other sour ingredients more liberally , displaying a Thai influence , while those from Singapore and Malacca use more coconut milk , exhibiting a stronger Indonesian influence .
Take for instance laksa , a spicy Nonya dish made with rice vermicelli and coconut milk and garnished with seafood or chicken .
You'll find the sour assam laksa in Penang while it is the coconut milk-based laksa lemak that is popular in Singapore .
Dine at a Peranakan restaurant such as Baba Inn & Lounge or True Blue Cuisine and you'll be able to sample signature dishes like the otak-otak , a blend of fish , coconut milk , chilli paste , galangal and herbs wrapped in a banana leaf ; ayam buah keluak , a chicken dish cooked with nuts in a rich sauce ; and itek tim , a classic soup made using duck , tomatoes , green peppers , salted vegetables and preserved sour plums simmered together .
Nonya desserts include kueh or cakes enriched with the sweet flavour of coconut and sweet , sticky delicacies .
Have a taste of authentic Peranakan food at Joo Chiat or Katong and take a look at the intricate beading and embroidered traditional costumes at Rumah Bebe .
You can also enjoy a Peranakan history lesson when you visit the Katong Antique House .
# NTU-MC/peranakan-trail
Take a walk along the Peranakan Trail to sample all things Peranakan in Singapore .

Have a stroll through the Spice Garden before heading back to the At-Sunrice academy ( a culinary centre dedicated to promoting pan-Asian cuisine and culinary skills ) , where you can join a cooking class to learn the intricacies of Peranakan cooking , influenced by techniques adopted from Malay and Chinese kitchens .
Next , make your way to the Peranakan Museum on nearby Armenian Street , for a full cultural immersion into the heritage , culture , language and costume , as well as the important traditions and rituals of the Peranakans .
With the finest and most comprehensive collection of Peranakan artefacts in the world , you'll discover all that you need to know about this unique fusion culture .
The Peranakan Trail typically encompasses the Joo Chiat area of Singapore , where you can absorb the relaxing atmosphere of this part of town , often associated with Peranakans and Eurasians .
Coming to Joo Chiat Complex , you'll find stores like Guan Huat Lee , which sells all sorts of kitchen utensils and crockery , Nyonya-inspired knick knacks , red wooden clogs and wooden moulds used to bake mooncakes ( round pastries with assorted fillings that are popularly seen during the Mid-Autumn Festival ) and Kway Guan Huat , one of the rare makers of popiah ( spring roll ) skins .
For accommodation around the area , visit Le Peranankan , a boutique hotel housed in a row of conserved shophouses .
Located at 400 East Coast Road , it features authentic Peranakan design , with rooms crafted in Nyonya and Baba styles .
The Joo Chiat and Katong districts in Singapore also pay homage to the fascinating background of the early Peranakans , whose opulent costumes , embroidery , beadwork , jewellery and furniture are a significant part of their culture .
Today , you'll find beautiful Peranakan fashion and decorative items at Rumah Bebe , which comes replete with intricate woodcarvings and furnishing in the beautifully restored house .
Finally , end your Peranakan Trail at dinner-time , trying fine Peranakan cuisine at the well known Peranakan Inn on East Coast Road , or Chilli Padi at Joo Chiat Place .

# NTU-MC/pongal
The Pongal Festival , or Sankaranthi , was originally held in celebration of a good harvest in South India , where farming is the main form of livelihood .
Here in Singapore , the Pongal Festival welcomes the beginning of the 10th Tamil month , called Thai , which falls in mid-January each year .
It is celebrated in the form of a thanksgiving and usually lasts four days .
Pongal literally means to boil over and hence the pot of rice is allowed to boil over as a sign of prosperity .
The first day of Pongal , called Bhogi Pongal , is spent spring cleaning and discarding old belongings to welcome a new beginning .
On the second day , Pongal is celebrated .
Hindu homes start the day with the preparation of pongal ( sweet sticky rice where milk , rice and sugar are boiled together ) cooked in a new pot that is presented as an offering to the Gods in return for their blessings .
On this same day , house visits are made and greetings are exchanged .
The third day , Mattu Pongal , is dedicated towards honouring the cattle , for ploughing the fields and for the milk they provide .
On this day the cattle are bathed , their horns painted and multi-coloured beads , tinkling bells and flower garlands are tied around their necks .
The fourth day , Kaanum Pongal , is for younger members of the family to pay respect to their elders .
On these days , Pongal rice is also prepared at all Hindu temples and special prayers are conducted .
In Little India , visitors can witness certain significant rituals and customs such as the honouring of the cattle and the Mass Pongal , which consists of a cooking competition among 20 families as part of a nine-day Pongal Festival .
During this joyous festival , Campbell Lane , in front of Serangoon Rood , is usually transformed into a pedestrian-only mini village .
You can browse the myriad of stalls and get your hands on unique souvenirs .
Culture vultures can also experience the daily Pongal themed cultural performances taking place .

Other meats that can be frequently prepared as Rendang include chicken and lamb .
Lemongrass , galangal , garlic , turmeric , ginger and chillies are some of the spices that are used , pounded into a Rempah ( spice mixture ) which is then used to coat the beef .
Coconut milk is then added and it is left to stew for a few hours .
However , many people believe that it tastes even better if left overnight .
Originally served during ceremonial occasions such as Hari Raya Aidilfitri , or to honour guests , Rendang is now eaten all year round .
It is rare to find Ren dang on its own , as it is often eaten with a variety of dishes in Nasi Padang .
These dishes include Ikan Bakar ( barbequed fish ) , Ayam Goreng ( fried chicken ) and Sayur Lodeh ( vegetable curry ) , together with rice , Ketupat ( rice dumpling ) or Lemang ( glutinous rice roasted in bamboo sticks) .
The Nasi Padang belt of Kandahar Street , located at the historic Kampong Glam area , houses numerous Nasi Padang stalls which are known for their tender and aromatic Rendang .

# NTU-MC/rojak
One rojak variation is adapted from Malay and Chinese cuisines , which is a veritable toss of beansprouts , greens , tau pok ( or deep-fried soybean cake ) , yu tiao ( a crispy long strip of fried flour ) pineapple , cucumber , and a generous sprinkle of finely chopped roasted peanuts well-tossed ( which gives it ample texture and a lovely crunchy bite ) with a spicy fermented prawn paste sauce .
The other is the Indian version , which is also tossed in peanut sauce , although this version has an added red flavouring and colour for that tinge of spiciness .
The Indian rojak can be personalised to one's specific tastebuds as most stall vendors allow their patrons to choose the ingredients that they want - which includes baked potatoes , steamed fishcakes , prawn fritters , octopus , a mix of fried greens and many more .
Yet again , this is a popular dish in Singapore , so finding a rojak stall near you won't be too much of a hassle .
While the best rojak stalls are found outside the city ( like in neighbourhoods like Bukit Merah and Katong ) there are still reasonably good places within the CBD or in the Orchard Road area where you can find them .
The Food Republic food courts in Wisma Atria and 313@Somerset are easy enough to find ; but also do check out Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt Regency hotel along Scotts Road for a sampling of this true-blue Singapore dish in a stylish , sleek setting .

# NTU-MC/roti-prata
Roti prata evolved from the original pancake recipes from Pakistan and India , and is a favourite in Singapore .
Roti means " bread " , and prata means " flat " , but it is actually closer to a pancake with a lightly flavoured and subtle sweet dough that makes for a gratifying meal , especially in the mornings .
While commonly served plain with dhal or curry , local menus now feature a variety of eccentric variations such as durian , ice-cream , cheese , chocolate and banana , all worth a try for the adventurous diner .
It is also not unusual to see prata - as it's commonly known to the locals - being eaten with a sprinkle of sugar , as this brings out its natural taste .
The sight of the prata maker making the dish is a sight to behold .
Look out for quick finger and hand movements ; a toss in the air ; and vigorous slaps and smacks just before serving to make it light yet doughy .
And forget about eating this with a fork and spoon ; the best way to sample the magic of the prata is by dunking it in the complementary curry ( usually mutton or fish-based ) with your fingers .
Only then will you fully understand the phrase , " Finger licking good !
" Between the many prata stalls , you'll also find that the texture of the dough differs , ranging from soft and chewy to super crispy , with most being somewhere in the middle .
Egg lovers should also try the egg prata , a filling and savoury version that's hugely popular with the locals .
The roti prata is ubiquitous throughout Singapore , and chances are that you'll find a prata stall a stone's throw away from your hotel .
Just ask your concierge to point you in the right direction ; they'll only be too glad to help , as Singaporeans pride themselves in knowing the best places in town to get the best local chow .

# NTU-MC/sakya-muni-buddha-gaya-temple
One of the most prominent and widely visited Buddhist temples in Singapore , The Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple is often referred to as the Temple of 1,000 Lights .

In a chamber at the back of the statue , you‘ll also find the image of the reclining Buddha that must be seen to be believed .
It's a powerful figure that is not just worth taking many snapshots of , but its sheer size will simply awe and inspire not just devotees , but anyone who can appreciate marvellous architecture .
# NTU-MC/satay
Often served in bunches of 10 ( individual sticks are also sold ) , it goes in accord with a dip of spicy and sweet peanut sauce , and is usually accompanied with chopped onion , cucumber and ketupat ( Malay rice cakes wrapped in a weaving pattern of coconut leaves) .
Interestingly , the peanut sauce ( made from a slew of spices and ground peanuts ) was first served in the Philippines where it was introduced by its colonial overlords , the Spanish , who in turn borrowed the recipe during their time in South America .
Though the satay sticks of today are factory-processed strips made from bamboo , it was the humble dried leaf stem of the coconut leaf which was first used to skewer the meat centuries ago .
Barbecued over an open-flamed charcoal fire , the satay is feverishly brushed with oil to give it a well-browned glaze .
One of the most famous Malay dishes in Singapore , satay is a must-try , and is served at many hawkers , restaurants and food centres , including the East Coast Food Lagoon and the famous 24-hour Lau Pa Sat Festival Market , where no less than a dozen stalls selling only satay hold fort .
A new addition in recent years has been the pork satay , introduced by Chinese satay sellers , giving this centuries-old item another delightful twist .

# NTU-MC/singapore-hong-san-see
Built between 1908 and 1913 , the Hong San See temple , located along Mohamed Sultan Road , was originally located at Tras Street in Tanjong Pagar in 1829 .
Established by the Hokkien people of the Lam Ann clan , this temple is dedicated to Guang Ze Zun Wang , the God of Fortune .
It later relocated to Mohamed Sultan road , and the temple now draws worshippers from different dialect groups .
Designed by Lim Loh , a well-known contractor , the temple , with its axial planning , courtyards and walled enclosures , is built in the southern Chinese traditional temple style .
The prayer and entrance halls are richly decorated , with light reflecting the beautiful wood carvings from China .

# NTU-MC/singapore-sling
New York has its Manhattan , Moscow its mule and Long Island its Iced Tea .
In turn , Singapore has the honour of having one of the hardest cocktails to make .
Formulated at the turn of the century , the Singapore Sling was initially called the Straits Sling , and was created as a lady's cocktail , hence its pinkish tone .
Recipes vary , but according to the Raffles Hotel , the original consists of gin , cherry liquer , Benedictine , pomegranate juice and pineapple juice from Sarawak pineapples , to create the foamy top .
However , many recent recipes use bottled juice , while adding club soda for the foam .
A handwritten bar-chit by Ngiam , dated 1936 , still hangs in the Raffles Hotel Museum .
The " Million Dollar Cocktail " was also created by Ngiam , where it gained similar recognition after Somerset Maugham featured it in his short story , " The Letter" .
The Singapore Sling has proven so popular that bottled versions are now also available in commercial supermarkets and shops .
Drinks and other Singapore Sling products can be found at the Singapore Sling boutique at Clark Quay .
Even though you might want to head down to the Long Bar and order yourself an authentic Singapore Sling while embracing the nostalgia of the Raffles Hotel , there are other bars which also do great versions of this drink .
OverEasy at One Fullerton whips up an excellent Singapore Sling with a touch of Angostura Bitters , while Orgo at the Esplanade blends theirs with freshly squeezed pineapple , lime and pomegranate juice .

# NTU-MC/singlish-guide
While it may not be recognised in the world as a formal language , a bit of knowledge on Singlish is definitely essential when travelling around Singapore .
It is a unique blend of English , Chinese , Malay , Tamil and local dialects .
To some , it is a beautiful language that proudly displays the multi-cultural character of our society ; to others , it is a colloquialism so full of grammatical errors that it makes you squirm each time you hear it .
Regardless , it is useful to understand a fair bit of Singlish , or at least understand the most common phrases used to avoid getting ‘lost in translation' .
Besides the typical " lah " which punctuates most sentences used by the locals , here is a quick guide of phrases that you may encounter and use most often : Don't pray pray ah !
: " Don't mess around !
" Oh , izzit ?
: " That's interesting .
" / " Oh, is that true ?
" Dohwan : " No, thanks .
" / " I don't want it .
" Kiasu : A general term used to describe the highly competitive nature of many Singaporeans .
It is originally a Chinese dialect expression that literally means " fear of losing" .
So how ?
: " So what do we do now ?
" Alamak !
: A general expression of dismay or incredulity .
Can can !
: " Yes , definitely .
" Auntie / Uncle : A respectful form of an address for an older man / woman , respectively .

# NTU-MC/thaipusam
Thaipusam is a highly symbolic Hindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community .
It is an annual procession by Hindu devotees seeking blessings , fulfilling vows and offering thanks .
Celebrated in honour of Lord Subrahmanya ( also known as Lord Murugan ) , who represents virtue , youth and power to Hindus and is the destroyer of evil , it is held during the full moon in the 10th Tamil month , called Thai , which falls in mid-January each year .
In Singapore , the Thaipusam ceremony starts in the early hours of the morning where devotees fulfill their vows with a 4.5 km walk from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple along Serangoon Road to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple on Tank Road .
The first batches of devotees usually carry milk pots and wooden Kavadis .
A Kavadi consists of two semicircular pieces of wood or steel which are attached to a cross structure that can be balanced on the shoulders of a devotee .
It is often decorated with flowers , palm leaves and peacock feathers .
The milk they have been carrying is then offered to Lord Subrahmanya at the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple .
Some devotees also pierce their tongues with skewers and carry a garlanded wooden arch across their shoulders .
Devotees carrying spiked Kavadis , which require elaborate preparations , leave the temple in the later part of the morning and continue till night .
The festival is not just an exclusively Indian affair ; several Chinese devotees and people of other races also come to fulfill their vows on this day .
The festival is a visual spectacle and it often brings traffic in the city centre to a standstill , with a colourful procession full of chanting and dizzying rhythms of Indian drums .
In preparation for carrying a Kavadi , a devotee has to prepare himself spiritually .
For a period of about a month , the devotee must live a life of abstinence whilst maintaining a strict vegetarian diet .
It is believed that only when the mind is free of material wants and the body free from physical pleasures that a devotee can undertake the sacred task without feeling any pain .
The devotees are normally accompanied by friends and family members who cheer and offer support , usually in the form of prayers and chants .
Witness the sacred ritual of Thaipusam when in Singapore , a true act of faith .

# NTU-MC/vesak-day
Vesak Day is the most significant day of the year in the Buddhist calendar and is celebrated by Buddhists the world over .
The day commemorates the birth , enlightenment and death of the Buddha and is a day of immense joy , peace and reflection .
In Singapore , Vesak Day usually falls in the month of May , on the 15th day of the fourth month of the Chinese Lunar Calendar .
On this day , devout Buddhists and followers alike congregate at their various temples before dawn for the ceremonial , where the Buddhist flag will be hoisted , and hymns sung in praise of the holy triple gem : The Buddha , The Dharma ( his teachings ) , and The Sangha ( his disciples) .
Devotees often bring simple offerings of flowers , candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their spiritual teacher .
These symbolic offerings remind followers that life too , is subject to decay and destruction when the offering burns out or wilts away .
Buddhists believe that performing good deeds on Vesak Day will multiply merit many times over .
Buddhist youth sometimes organise mass blood donations at hospitals , while general rites and rituals practiced on Vesak Day include chanting of mantras ; releasing of caged birds and animals ; having vegetarian meals ; and " bathing " a Buddha statue , a reference to the legend of the child Buddha being showered with the waters of nine dragons soon after birth .
These acts of generosity observed by the Buddhist temples are also known as Dana .
Most statues of the Lord Buddha are illuminated on Vesak Day , and the celebrations conclude with a candlelight procession through the streets .
The Buddhist community in Singapore is made up of various sectors , each of them offering variant ways of celebrating the occasion - The Mahayana or " Greater Way " constitutes mainly Chinese Singaporeans and form the majority of Buddhists here , while the Mahayana strain of Buddhism arrived on these shores in 1884 through individual missionaries from China's southern province .
The central pillar of Mahayana Buddhism is that Nirvana can be obtained not just through self-perseverance but also through the help of bodhisattvas or " enlightened ones" .
One such bodhisattva highly regarded in Singapore is Guanyin , the " Goddess of Mercy" .
Mahayana Buddhist temples in Singapore like the Phor Kark See Temple on Bright Hill Road , practise the " three-step , one-bow " ritual on Vesak Day , where devotees take steps on both knees , bowing at every third step as they pray for world peace , personal blessings and repentance .
The exhausting two-hour procession actually begins 24 hours before , when many would reserve a place in the procession , sometimes with only a small tissue packet .
Meanwhile another main variant of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism , with a focus on seeking one's own path to salvation .
Mainly practised by Singapore's Sri Lankan and Burmese communities , the Burmese Buddhist Temple at Geylang and the Sri Lankaramaya Temple at St Michael's Road practise a ritual of cooking a pot of rice in milk on Vesak Day , reminiscent of Buddha's last meal before his long fast toward enlightenment .
A great place to observe and mark this holy day in Singapore is at the majestic Lian Shan Shuang Lin Temple which literally translates to the Twin Grove of the Lotus Mountain Buddhist Temple .
Built between the years of 1902 to 1908 , it is Singapore's oldest Buddhist temple and the second largest in Asia .
You can also soak in the spirit of the Vesak Day celebrations at The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple , a four-storey spiritual centre in the heart of Chinatown .
It is architecturally inspired by the harmonious combination of the Buddhist mandala and the art culture of Buddhism in the Tang dynasty .
